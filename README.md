# foodwebs_env_variation_coexistence
Final code to accompany the manuscript "Quantifying the relative importance of competition, predation, and environmental variation for species coexistence"

**Repository organization**

:file_folder: **classic_diamond_model**: code to simulate the classic diamond model with 1 resourse, 2 consumers, and 1 predator, and to partition the influence of variation in the environment and predation on coexistence of consumer species.

:file_folder: **expanded_model**: code to run the simulation of the expanded diamond model, including with (1) 3 consumers and 1 predator and (2) 3 consumers and 2 pedators.

:file_folder: **intertidal_model**: code to run the simulation of the rocky intertidal food web, and to partition the influence of variation in the environment and predation on coexistence of barnacles and limpets.
